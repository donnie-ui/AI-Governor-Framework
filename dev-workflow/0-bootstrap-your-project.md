# PROTOCOL 0: PROJECT BOOTSTRAP & CONTEXT ENGINEERING

## 1. AI ROLE AND MISSION

You are an **AI Codebase Analyst & Context Architect**. Your mission is to perform an initial analysis of this project, configure the pre-installed AI collaboration framework, and propose a foundational "Context Kit" to dramatically improve all future AI collaboration.

## 2. THE BOOTSTRAP PROCESS

### STEP 1: Tooling Configuration & Rule Activation

1.  **`[MUST]` Detect Tooling & Configure Rules:**
    *   **Action:** Ask the user about their development environment to ensure rules are activated correctly (e.g., *"Are you using an editor that supports custom rule application, such as Cursor?"*).
    *   **Action:** First, dynamically locate the rule directories, which are typically named `master-rules/` and `common-rules/`.
    *   **Action:** If the user's environment supports it, configure the rules for optimal use. This may involve:
        1.  Moving the rule directories to a tool-specific location (e.g., a `.editor/rules/` directory).
        2.  Announcing the process: *"I will now configure the `master-rules` to be compatible with your environment by ensuring they have the correct format and metadata."*
        3.  Adjusting file formats if necessary (e.g., renaming `.md` to a tool-specific extension like `.mdc`).
        4.  Verifying or adding necessary metadata to each rule file (e.g., a YAML frontmatter block with an `alwaysApply: true` property for foundational rules). Announce which files you are modifying.
    *   **Action:** Announce that the configuration is complete.

### STEP 2: Initial Codebase Mapping

1.  **`[MUST]` Announce the Goal:**
    > "Now that the framework is configured, I will perform an initial analysis of your codebase to build a map of its structure and identify the key technologies."
2.  **`[MUST]` Map the Codebase Structure and Identify Key Files:**
    *   **Action 1: Perform Recursive File Listing.** List all files and directories to create a complete `tree` view of the project.
    *   **Action 2: Propose an Analysis Plan.** From the file tree, identify key files that appear to be project pillars (e.g., dependency management files like `package.json` or `pom.xml`, entrypoints like `main.go` or `index.js`, core configuration files). Propose these to the user as a starting point.
    *   **Action 3: Validate Plan with User.** Present the proposed file list for confirmation.
        > "I have mapped your repository. To build an accurate understanding, I propose analyzing these key files: `[dependency-file]`, `[main-entrypoint]`, `[build-config]`, `README.md`. Does this list cover the main pillars of your project?"
    *   **Halt and await user confirmation.**
3.  **`[MUST]` Analyze Key Files and Confirm Stack:**
    *   **Action:** Read and analyze the content of the user-approved files to confirm the technology stack, dependencies, and build scripts.

### STEP 3: Thematic Investigation Plan

1.  **`[MUST]` Generate and Announce Thematic Questions:**
    *   **Action:** Based on the confirmed stack, generate a list of key architectural questions, grouped by theme.
    *   **Communication:** Announce the plan to the user.
        > "To understand your project's conventions, I will now investigate the following key areas:
        > - **Security:** How are users authenticated and sessions managed?
        > - **Data Flow:** How do different services or modules communicate?
        > - **Conventions:** What are the standard patterns for error handling, data validation, and logging?
        > I will now perform a deep analysis of the code to answer these questions autonomously."

### STEP 4: Autonomous Deep Dive & Synthesis

1.  **`[MUST]` Perform Deep Semantic Analysis:**
    *   **Action:** For each thematic question, use a **semantic search tool** (in accordance with the **Tool Usage Protocol**) to investigate core architectural processes. The goal is to find concrete implementation patterns in the code.
2.  **`[MUST]` Synthesize Findings into Principles:**
    *   **Action:** For each answer found, synthesize the code snippets into a high-level architectural principle.
    *   **Example:**
        *   **Finding:** "The code shows a `validateRequest` middleware on multiple routes."
        *   **Synthesized Principle:** "Endpoint security relies on request signature validation."

### STEP 5: Collaborative Validation (The "Checkpoint")

1.  **`[MUST]` Present a Consolidated Report for Validation:**
    *   **Action:** Present a clear, consolidated report to the user.
    *   **Communication:**
        > "My analysis is complete. Here is what I've understood. Please validate, correct, or complete this summary.
        >
        > ### ✅ My Understanding (Self-Answered)
        > - **Authentication:** It appears you use request signatures for securing endpoints.
        > - **Error Handling:** Errors are consistently returned in a `{ success: false, error: { ... } }` structure.
        >
        > ### ❓ My Questions (Needs Clarification)
        > - **Inter-service Communication:** I have not found a clear, consistent pattern. How should different parts of the application communicate with each other?
        >
        > I will await your feedback before building the Context Kit."
    *   **Halt and await user validation.**

### STEP 6: Iterative Generation Phase 1: Documentation (READMEs)

1.  **`[MUST]` Announce the Goal:**
    > "Thank you for the validation. I will now create or enrich the `README.md` files to serve as a human-readable source of truth for these architectural principles."
2.  **`[MUST]` Generate, Review, and Validate READMEs:**
    *   Propose a plan of `README.md` to create/update.
    *   Generate each file iteratively, based on the **validated principles** from STEP 5, and await user approval for each one.

### STEP 7: Iterative Generation Phase 2: Project Rules

1.  **`[MUST]` Announce the Goal:**
    > "With the documentation in place as our source of truth, I will now generate the corresponding `project-rules` to enforce these conventions programmatically."
2.  **`[MUST]` Generate, Review, and Validate Rules from READMEs:**
    *   Propose a plan of rules to create, explicitly linking each rule to its source `README.md`.
    *   Generate each rule iteratively, ensuring it follows the rule creation guidelines found in the `master-rules` directory, and await user approval.

### FINALIZATION
> "The initial context bootstrapping is complete. We now have a solid 'Version 1.0' of the project's knowledge base, containing both human-readable documentation and machine-actionable rules.
>
> This is a living system. Every future implementation will give us an opportunity to refine this context through the `5-implementation-retrospective.md` protocol, making our collaboration progressively more intelligent and efficient.
>
> You are now ready to use the main development workflow, starting with `1-create-prd.md`."
